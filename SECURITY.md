## ⚠️ Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Download Only from Official Sources**
   - GitHub Releases: ✅ Safe
   - Official Website: ✅ Safe
   - Third-party sites: ❌ Potentially dangerous

2. **Verify Downloads**
   - Check SHA256 checksums
   - Verify digital signatures
   - Scan with antivirus software

3. **System Protection**
   - Keep Windows updated
   - Use standard user accounts when possible
   - Enable Windows Defender or equivalent

4. **Gaming Security**
   - Only run on legal copies of TEKKEN 8
   - Don't disable antivirus for the assistant
   - Backup your game saves before use

### For Developers
1. **Secure Development**
   - Follow OWASP guidelines
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Code review all changes
   - Test in isolated environments

2. **Build Security**
   - Reproducible builds
   - Signed commits
   - Protected branches
   - Automated security testing

## 🔍 Known Security Considerations

### Intentional Limitations
- **Admin Rights**: Required for some system-level game optimizations
- **File Access**: Needs read/write access to TEKKEN installation directory
- **Process Management**: May launch game processes with elevated privileges

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Minimal Permissions**: Request only necessary access rights
- **Temporary Elevation**: Drop privileges after installation
- **User Consent**: Clear warnings for elevated operations
- **Audit Trail**: Log security-relevant operations
